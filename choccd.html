 <p>Slow and low have always been one of my favorite flavors. I love the deep rumbling tone. The side-to-side repetition. Sliding things down is natural for me. Always has been, always will be. No matter the style. Chopped and screwed music has been something I have been dabbling with for years. Some of you might be familiar or even a fan of some of my past dips into the palate in past. Sometimes things you feel and things you experience puts you in a type of place where everything seems like it's been leading you, guiding you along your path. You're called and when you answer, it pulls you through the right doors. Last year things that have been surrounding me and coming in and out of my life collided at once. I caught a type of flow with a specific type of sound... A type of feeling. A translation of feeling, beliefs, and thought into sound... Into 'tapes' that represented a wide array of feelings, practices, memories, and intuition. These tapes are meant to give you not the same influences I put in, but for you to build your own experience and relate your own memories... Or create new ones.... These tapes are a soundtrack of the past, present, and future all in one. Chocc'd and Screwed Vol 1. 20 tracks to gift you and your life.</p>
