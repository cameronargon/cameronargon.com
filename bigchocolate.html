<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>Big Chocolate's 2022 release Dubstep for Moms combines the elements of dubstep and downtempo electronica to create a mellow and sophisticated listening experience. The album starts off with the vocal infused deep dubstep that Big Chocolate has teased at recently and quickly transitions into a more ambient downtempo listening experience, drawing influence from classic dubstep, minimal trip-hop, and other downtempo genres. Synths and melodic bass lines mix with modern production techniques to create a unique listening experience each time. Most especially noteworthy is how Big Chocolate incorporates repetitive vocal samples from various different hypnotic techniques in his soundscapes.</p>
<p>The production value of this album is on par with some of the best in deep dubstep, showcasing Big Chocolate's talent for making an electronic production that moves your feet, yet keeps your head nodding. The diversity of the tracks is sparse; staying strictly on topic to demonstrate the craftsman at work.</p>
<p>Thanks to his unique blend of diverse electronica styles - Big Chocolate's Dubstep for Moms has established itself as an essential listening experience. This album proves Big Chocolate is one of the most forward thinking producers in the genre and brings something different to the table.</p>
<p>8.0/10</p>
